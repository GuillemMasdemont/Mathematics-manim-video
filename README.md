The code written in this github file is aimed for other students or programmers who seek examples of manim animations. This code was written for a university mathematics video competition which took place in 2023. The final video result can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ent_SkPIj4I. 

The whole video was sliced into eleven scences. All the scenes can be downloaded from the scene_video and the corresponding code can be found in scene_code file. (I'll be uploading all the content through the following months.)

When it comes to using Manim library: 

· Recommend to use it through anaconda and a jupyter notebook launcher setting up a new conda-environment. 
  Further information for installing manim can be found in: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/conda.html
	
· Manim is a relatively new library and some information may be difficult to find. I recommend to check 3blue1brown's github for particular animations and detailed code.
